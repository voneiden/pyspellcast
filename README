==Spellcast==

A game of duelling wizards,
as seen on http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/spellbnd.htm

Client layout is a rip off of wxSpellcast - a project seemingly 
abandoned in 2002, which in turn had they layout ripped off from
the original X11 game Spellcast.. I don't know, the last update 
was in 2001.

All in all, this is now a work in progress, I'm not good at finishing
projects, so if anybody wants to contribute, you're most welcome. I
personally hope that the python source makes it easier for people to 
get involved, but anyway let's see.
